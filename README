# Statistical-Analysis-of-Healthcare-Data
This project is dedicated to downloading, pre-preparing and making statistical analysis of ELISA tests and collected information about IgG and IgM, influenza vaccination, tuberculosis vaccination and previous diseases, blood group respondents have.
In this project, I have used the methods of statistical analysis of data obtained via a people survey on the disease of COVID-19. The project consists of three stages:
<ul>
  <li>Data download</li>
  <li>Data preparation</li>
  <li>Statistical analysis</li>
  <li>Data visualization</li>
  </ul>
The first stage will show how to download spreadsheet data:
<ul>
  <li>indexing of key fields</li>
  <li>working with data types such as datatime</li>
  <li>writing a parser function to automatically create index fields</li>
  </ul>
At the next stage, it will be demonstrated how to pre-prepare data for analysis, in particular:
<ul>
<li>elimination of missing data</li>
  <li>replacement and change of cell data</li>
  <li>change the data types of columns</li>
  </ul>
At the stage of statistical analysis, the methods of automation of statistical information calculation will be demonstrated:
<ul>
  <li>calculation of basic statistical indicators</li>
  <li>data sorting and grouping</li>
  <li>data transformation DataSet</li>
  <li>calculation of statistical indicators on the transformed data</li>
At the stage of visualization, the possibilities of visualization of the received statistical indicators will be shown.

The statistical data obtained during a survey by scientists of the Department of Artificial Intelligence Systems of the National University of Lviv Polytechnic has been used in this project.
